You can either edit files or add entirely new ones here.

NOTE: Some or most assets are from FNF Vs. AumSum DE or a few other mods so they're probably just either taken from it or recycled.

ABOUT EDITTING:
It doesn't matter if you want to edit something in assets/shared/images/ or assets/preload/images/,
you will have to put the editted files in mods/images/, it will be handled automatically by the engine.
